---------------------- Visual Test for your Classifier -------------------------

This test is intended to give you a feeling of how the accuracy of your predictions 
reflects visually. It uses the first 50 instances of class +1 and the first 50 instances 
of class -1 of the training set.

Steps:

1. Use the data set on visual_test_set.csv to test your model and store the predictions 
in prediction.csv. Each line should contain the predicted class (+1 or -1) for the 
corresponding line in visual_test_set.csv. 

2. Run visual_test.py to find out the accuracy of your model on the visual_test_set and 
to generate an html page that contains the images used for testing. The images are 
categorized as well cassified and missclassified for each of the classes.

3. Open results.html to check the accuracy of your classification.
